what's something your child has done that you're going to talk about forever my 15 month old daughter sleeps 9 10 hours straight in her cot which is attached to our bed when she needs to feed she moves towards me without opening eyes I get her signal and feed her I couldn't pay attention to my health recently due to baby home and work responsibilities which is a usual story of mommies yesterday I was having bad cold and cough the coughing increased a lot later at night and I was not able to sleep properly I was missing my parents specially my mom at that time I was deeply sad and was crying silently so that my husband and baby shouldn't get Disturbed my baby is usual needed feet and moved towards me but since I was coughing and crying both at the same time she got up from sleep I became more on the contrary my baby looked at me for a few seconds and then took my face in her little hands she cute Words which have no meaning and then kiss me couple of times I was overwhelmed at this actor I hugged her and we were sleeping like that until morning
